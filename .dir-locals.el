;; This file contains recommended Emacs settings for working on this

;;
;; See the Emacs Manual node "Directory Variables" for information on

;; Note: I'm usually not in favor of including stuff that might be
;; specific to a developer's specific workflow in a git repository,
;; but since this is currently a personal toy project, and I deem the
;; settings here generally useful, I opted for including this file. If
;; you happen to be a fellow Emacs user and take offence on the
;; contents of this file, I'll be glad to address your concerns in the
;; project issue you will doubtlessly open ;-).
